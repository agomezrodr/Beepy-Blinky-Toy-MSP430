Project by Adrian Gomez Rodriguez

    This project was really interesting for me because I have to make a very long
    reaserch to understand the demos that our TA and the proffesor give
    us. However, with the help of the book, my proffesor and some friends 
    I could understand the meaning of the P1OUT, P1DIR, P2SEL, etc. Also, 
    the use of the bottons and the LEDs was a big challenge for me
    but I think the more complicate challenge about this lab is
    to create the molody using frequency on the MSP430. One thing that
    I think it was very important in this lab, was the transition of 
    states becaus that is the way that I use to make work buttons, 
    melody and LED's. Finally, I hope that the knowledge that I got
    on this lab can help me to understand and work on the next lab. 
    Here is my explication of how to make my program work using the 
    make file.

To compile my programs: $ make

To run my program: $ make load

To delete binaries: $ make clear


Thank you.
